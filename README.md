Very basic Linear Algebra operations implemented in C, C++ and CUDA.

Focus on parallelization and possibility to be called from Python.

An idea can be to stick with C and write my own numerical linear algebra routines, so to:

    - revise basic Mathematics and C, too
    - natively implement the possibility to parallelize the code
    - make it callable from Python
    - include random number generators and basis statistical tests
